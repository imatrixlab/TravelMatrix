### Suite for Product Management
For managing any kind of product, whether it is static or negotiated contracts, we provide an end-to-end product management solution with sophisticated product loading features.

In order to successfully respond to clients, it is simple to manage rates, regulations, conditions, discounts, and supplements in real-time.

### Connectivity & Aggregation of Suppliers
In order to provide the greatest vacation package in real-time, our travel technology platform functions as a travel aggregator, providing a wide range of third-party connectors, such as GDS, Channel Managers, hotels, cars, cruises, trains, flights, and so on. These connectors are combined across several components and inventories. In order to provide the optimal search result, the Search Preference (SP) rule manages the source inventory, inventory sorting procedures, and results that are pushed through de-duplication.

### Sensible Content Mapping
Through Content Normalization, rich content is assiduously mapped from several sources under a single inventory profile. With the use of fuzzy logic principles and artificial intelligence algorithms, TravelMatrix™ travel technology solution provides the optimal match in an intuitive manner.

### Globalization & Multi-distribution
Utilizing a single, unified platform, our travel technology platform allows you to globalize your travel business across many company divisions, brands, distribution channels, source markets, destinations, client groups, currencies, and multilingual content.
